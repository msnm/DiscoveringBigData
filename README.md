# Discovering BigData Technologies
## Introduction
In this repo you will find my adeventures in the world of BigData. 
This world is quite new for me, but I'm excited to start exploring it and creating my own BigData portfolio! It may contain flaws, but as I said I'm on a learning journey!

## Content
### The HadoopsEcosystem
The journey starts in the hadoop folder, where I will try to get a grasp on most of the components in the Hadoop's Ecosystem and  what they are useful for. Over time for each component a project folder will pop up in this main directory where the technology will be explored in greater depth.
  
### Spark
The spark folder contains coding adventures in Spark using Scala, and also some notes.
